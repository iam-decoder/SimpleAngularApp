# SimpleAngularApp
A simple application to show a basic implementation of AngularJS

## Application Purpose
All that this application is meant to do, is demonstrate how directives can really drive an application with strong functionality.

## Usage
Usage instructions can be found when loading the index.html page but just to re-iterate, here are the steps:
1. Type your name (or anything you want really) into the textbox on the screen
2. Press enter or tab to load the greeting message.
..* You could also click somewhere on the page rather than press a control button if you wish.
3. Read your personalized greeting and pat yourself on the back for a job well done!
